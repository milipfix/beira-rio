# Test Results - GitHub Pages Site

## Site Access
✅ **Site is accessible:** https://milipfix.github.io/beira-rio/site_structure.html

## Issue Identified
❌ **GitHub Pages not updating:** The GitHub Pages site is not reflecting the latest changes from the repository. The file was successfully committed to GitHub but the live site is showing an older version.

## Current Status
✅ **Local file:** Contains all new sections (Locations Map and Execution Workflow)
✅ **GitHub repository:** File was successfully pushed with 1675 lines
❌ **GitHub Pages:** Still showing old version without new sections

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be that GitHub Pages is not automatically rebuilding from the master branch. This could be due to:
1. GitHub Pages not being enabled for this repository
2. GitHub Pages configured to build from a different branch
3. Caching issues on GitHub Pages

## Recommendation
The user should manually enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and configure it to build from the master branch.
